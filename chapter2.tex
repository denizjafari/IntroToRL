\begin{exercise}
In "$\epsilon$-greedy action selection, for the case of two actions and " $\epsilon= 0.5$, what is
the probability that the greedy action is selected?
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}
It is simply $1-\epsilon= 0.5$.
\end{solution}

\subsection{2.3}
The epsilon=0.01 because the probability is $\frac{\sum 1_{A_{i}=a}}{N}\to \frac{\epsilon}{k}+1-\epsilon$. If we have epsilon=0, we get stuck in the case of $Q_1(a)=0$ to $A_{1}=0$.
