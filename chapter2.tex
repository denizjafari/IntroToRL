\begin{exercise}
In "$\epsilon$-greedy action selection, for the case of two actions and " $\epsilon= 0.5$, what is
the probability that the greedy action is selected?
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}
We have
\begin{align*}
Prob(\text{  greedy action is selected })=&Prob(\text{  greedy action is selected },random)+Prob(\text{  greedy action is selected },optimal)    \\
&=\epsilon+(1-\epsilon)\frac{1}{2}\\
&=0.75.
\end{align*}
\end{solution}

\subsection{2.2}

\begin{exercise}
Bandit example Consider a $k$-armed bandit problem with $k = 4$ actions, denoted $1, 2, 3$, and $4$. Consider applying to this problem a bandit algorithm using $\e$-greedy action selection, sample-average action-value estimates, and initial estimates of $Q_1(a) = 0$, for all $a$. Suppose the initial sequence of actions and rewards is $A1 = 1, R1 = 1, A2 = 2, R2 = 1, A3 = 2, R3 = 2, A4 = 2, R4 = 2, A5 = 3, R5 = 0.$ On some of these time steps the $\e$ case may have occurred, causing an action to be selected at random. On which time steps did this definitely occur? On which time steps could this possibly have occurred?
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}

\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{ccccccc}
Timestep $t$ & $Q_{t}(1)$ & $Q_{t}(1)$    & $Q_{t}(1)$  & $Q_{t}(1)$ & Greedy action & Action selected\\
\hline 
t=0&0&0&0&0&-&$A_{1}$\\
\hline 
t=1&&&&&&$A_{2}$\\
\hline 
t=2&&&&&&$A_{2}$\\
\hline 
t=3&&&&&&$A_{2}$\\
\hline 
t=4&&&&&&$A_{5}$\\
\hline 
t=5&&&&&&end\\
\end{tabularx}


\end{solution}


1)On which time steps did this definitely occur?\\
t=1 

t=4


2)On which time steps could this possibly have occurred?\\
t=2

t=5
because the optimal is action=2.

3)optimal selection\\

t=3

\subsection{2.3}
The epsilon=0.01 because the probability is $\frac{\sum 1_{A_{i}=a}}{N}\to \frac{\epsilon}{k}+1-\epsilon$. If we have epsilon=0, we get stuck in the case of $Q_1(a)=0$ to $A_{1}=0$.
