\begin{exercise}
In "$\epsilon$-greedy action selection, for the case of two actions and " $\epsilon= 0.5$, what is
the probability that the greedy action is selected?
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}
Write $G:=\{\text{greedy action is selected}\}$. We have
\begin{align*}
Prob(\text{ G })=&Prob(\text{ G },random)+Prob(\text{ G },optimal)    \\
&=\epsilon+(1-\epsilon)\frac{1}{2}\\
&=0.75.
\end{align*}  
\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}
Bandit example Consider a $k$-armed bandit problem with $k = 4$ actions, denoted $1, 2, 3$, and $4$. Consider applying to this problem a bandit algorithm using $\e$-greedy action selection, sample-average action-value estimates, and initial estimates of $Q_1(a) = 0$, for all $a$. Suppose the initial sequence of actions and rewards is $A1 = 1, R1 = -1, A2 = 2, R2 = 1, A3 = 2, R3 = -2, A4 = 2, R4 = 2, A5 = 3, R5 = 0.$ On some of these time steps the $\e$ case may have occurred, causing an action to be selected at random. On which time steps did this definitely occur? On which time steps could this possibly have occurred?
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}


We denote the sample average action value after n-steps as
\begin{equation}
\Large{Q_t}(a) = \frac{{\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{t - 1} {{R_i}{1_{{A_i} = a}}} }}{{\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{t - 1} {{1_{{A_i} = a}}} }}.
\end{equation}

\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{ccccccc}
Timestep $t$ & $Q_{t+1}(1)$ & $Q_{t+1}(2)$    & $Q_{t+1}(3)$  & $Q_{t+1}(4)$ & Greedy action & Action selected\\
\hline 
t=0&0&0&0&0&-&$A_{1}=1$\\
\hline 
t=1&$\frac{R_{1}}{1_{{A_1} = 1}}=-1$  & 0 &0&0&$2,3\tor 4$&$A_{2}=2$\\
\hline 
t=2& $-1$ &1&0&0&2&$A_{3}=2$\\
\hline 
t=3& -1& $\frac{R_{2}+R_{3}}{2}=-0.5$ &0&0&3\tor 4&$A_{4}=2$\\
\hline 
t=4& -1 &$\frac{R_{2}+R_{3}+R_{4}}{3}=\frac{1}{3}$&0  &0&3&$A_{5}=3$\\
\hline 
t=5&-1&1/3&0&0&3&end\\
\hline
\end{tabularx}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item step $t=1$ can be either exploration or exploitation because the optimal value is zero for all actions.

    \item step $t=2$, could be either exploration or exploitation because action=2 is optimal too.

    \item step $t=3$, is exploitation because the only optimal action was 2.

\item step $t=4$, is exploration because the action 2 is not optimal.

\item step $t=5$, is exploitation because action=$3$ is optimal.
    
\end{enumerate}






\end{solution}


1)On which time steps did this definitely occur?\\
t=1 

t=4


2)On which time steps could this possibly have occurred?\\
t=2

t=5
because the optimal is action=2.

3)optimal selection\\

t=3

\subsection{2.3}
The epsilon=0.01 because the probability is $\frac{\sum 1_{A_{i}=a}}{N}\to \frac{\epsilon}{k}+1-\epsilon$. If we have epsilon=0, we get stuck in the case of $Q_1(a)=0$ to $A_{1}=0$.
